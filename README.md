# vue-fake-chatbot
A simple Vue.js based fake chatbot conversation template or rather small demo.
Aimed a giving a rough idea on how it could be done.
No styling nor really neat code.
See [Live Demo](http://vue-fake-chatbot.isk.engineering)

## How-To
The `conversationTemplate` object, which is defined in the Vue.js' app data method, contains the entire conversation flow.
Pretty self-explanatory, an arbitrary amount of user-answer options can be defined for each bot-interaction.
Unfortunately it does not support merging the conversation back together, rather it can be seen as a conversation tree (in the proper sense).

## Future plans
This could become a neat little library for such fake chatbot applications if there is demand.

## License
Feel free to do whatever you want with it.
